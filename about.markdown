Hi, my name is Carlos.


I created this site to try out Github Pages and to archive some of the data exploration exercises I have been practicing. 


**What I am learning right now:**

[Python for Machine Learning & Data Science Masterclass](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-machine-learning-data-science-masterclass/) - Ongoing Feb 2025 (103 of 235 lessons completed â€“ L2 Regularization Ridge Regression)

**Past courses:**

[Intermediate SQL for Data Analysis](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/intermediate-sql-for-data-scientists) - Completed Jan 2025

[Python Data Analysis for Healthcare](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/python-data-analysis-for-healthcare) - Completed May 2024





A bit more.


I have worked with data for most of the last decade, in some way unintentionally. I became curious about programming languages as the data I worked with grew larger and started to break my spreadsheets. I took an intro course on Python and was lost (negative) in its vastness. I didn't know what to do with all that. I moved on to SQL which back then seemed less complicated. That change also came with me thinking more about data analysis and predictive analytics, which made it easier. I gave Python another try  while on parental leave in early 2023 and this time is going better. The rise of AI/GPTs has also made programming more accessible and interesting to casual users like me, so, here we are.
