Hi, my name is Carlos.

I started learning Python a couple of years ago. It didn’t work out that first time; I wasn’t sure about what I wanted to do with it. I moved on to SQL with data analysis in mind. It felt easier... at least querying data. Sometime in late 2022, I gave Python another try thinking also about data analysis, and this time it just clicked; I was captivated by Pandas right away and the possibility of predictive analytics.



What I am learning right now:
