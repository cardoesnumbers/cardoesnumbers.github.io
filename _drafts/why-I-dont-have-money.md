This is a quick exercise using Power BI to visualize my expenses during the last X months. I am focusing on house bills (energy, internet, mortgage, etc.), 
visits to the supermarket, outings (food and drinks) and the car expenses. 


We have tried to make some adjustments in how we do the groceries so I am interests in:

1. Are there any visible results? (line/stacked-bar)
2. When do I go to the supermarket? What days? (heatmap)
3. How often in a week and how much do I spend on average each time?

  
I think we go way too often and everytime we end up bring home more than we need.
