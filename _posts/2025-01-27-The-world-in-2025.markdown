This is a dataset with world indicators. I combined it with a subregions file because it would be more interesting than just using the continents as filters.

This post was also initially to test embedding a Tableau Public dashboard here. This doesn't work -?- as Github Pages are static. You can still look at the dashboard by clicking the image below.

In any case, I wanted to check how some of my preconceptions would hold up, e.g. the relation between education and fertility rates or overall access to health and life expectancy.
