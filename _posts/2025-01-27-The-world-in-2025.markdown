A quick exercise to test embedding the resulting dashboard from Tableau Public on this website (Note from Jan 2025: this doesnt work as Github Pages is static)

This is a dataset with world indicators. I combined it with a subregions file thinking it would be more interesting than just having the continents as filters.

I wanted to check how some of my preconceptions would hold. The relation between education vs fertility rates, or overall access to health and life expectancy.

Link and current embedding below. Check the “full screen” option for better results 🙂

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
