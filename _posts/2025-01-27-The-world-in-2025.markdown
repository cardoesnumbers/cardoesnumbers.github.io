A quick exercise to test embedding the resulting dashboard from Tableau Public on this website (Note from Jan 2025: this doesn't work as Github Pages are static)

This is a dataset with world indicators. I combined it with a subregions file because I thought it would be more interesting than just using the continents as filters.

I wanted to check how some of my preconceptions would hold, such as the relation between education and fertility rates or overall access to health and life expectancy.

And further analysis with pandas - This is pending until I figure out how to get includes folder :)
