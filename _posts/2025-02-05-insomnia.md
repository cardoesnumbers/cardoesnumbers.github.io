Just in case, I am not a doctor; this is a data exploration exercise and not medical advise in any way.

Melatonin and Zolpidem (Ambien) mentions are consistently on top while the relatively newer therapies (Belsomra, Dayvigo, Quviviq) are less discussed despite being considered to have a better safety profile than Zolpidem. Quviviq (Daridorexant) does show a positive trend which drives the collective mentions of DORAS up.


Let's start:


The data for this one comes from the [insomnia subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/) posts and comments section. The subreddit has 157k members. 47k unique users commented on posts from 22k unique original posters.


I was curious about the following: 

- Identifying the most mentioned insomnia drugs in the subreddit
- How awareness of different drugs/brands changed through time
- What time are people up and posting and replying


I have thought about doing a sentiment analysis or emotion detection link to each drug, eventually


Many thanks to Arthur Heitmann for his work with the Artict Shift project, which I used to extract the data from the subreddit.
Check it out here:


**[https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift](https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift)**


Steps so far:
1. Get the jsonl into a DataFrame
2. Clean it; take out "deleted" authors from posts and comments, and work with only the columns I find useful
3. Put together the texts columns ("post", "selftext", or "body" columns), tokenize and export it, to run it through a GPT to get drugs mentioned
4. Get all drugs mentioned to a list and analysis the frequency of mentions by month
5. Do the sentiment analysis on those drugs... EVENTUALLY
   

Here is the **comments** notebook / [nbviewer backup here](https://nbviewer.org/github/cardoesnumbers/cardoesnumbers.github.io/blob/main/assets/notebooks/insomnia_comments.ipynb)

I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet on the resulting csv files to identify the most mentioned drug therapies for the treatment of insomnia:

![Claude Screenshot1](/assets/images/claude-prompt.png)


- Zolpidem (including mentions as Ambien) is the most frequently mentioned drug, accounting for nearly one-third of all mentions
- Melatonin is the second most common, representing about a quarter of all mentions
- The top three drugs (Zolpidem, Melatonin, and Trazodone) together account for approximately 73% of all insomnia drug mentions in the dataset
- There's a significant presence of both dedicated sleep medications and medications that are sometimes prescribed off-label for sleep (such as quetiapine, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines)

Adding CBT, prescription need, and the different formulations for each drug and the time they were introduced in the US


| Rank | Drug/Molecule | Count | Percentage | Available Formulations | US Market Introduction | Prescription Required |
|------|---------------|--------|------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| 4 | Trazodone | 8,792 | 9.11% | Tablets (IR, CR), Oral solution | 1981 | Yes |

| 10 | Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) | 2,713 | 2.81% | Tablets, Capsules, Oral solution, IM injection | 1956 | Yes |
| 11 | Gabapentin (Neurontin) | 2,366 | 2.45% | Capsules, Tablets, Oral solution | 1993 | Yes |
| 12 | Doxepin (Silenor) | 2,340 | 2.42% | Tablets, Capsules, Oral solution, Topical cream | 1969 (2010) | Yes |
| 13 | Lorazepam (Ativan) | 2,272 | 2.35% | Tablets, Oral solution, IV/IM injection, Sublingual tablets | 1977 | Yes |
| 14 | Daridorexant (Quviviq) | 1,689 | 1.75% | Tablets | 2022 | Yes |
| 15 | Diazepam (Valium) | 1,680 | 1.74% | Tablets, Oral solution, IV/IM injection, Rectal gel | 1963 | Yes |
| 16 | CBT-I/CBT Terms | 6,447 | 6.68% | Non-pharmaceutical intervention | N/A | N/A |


Notes:
- Melatonin became widely available as a dietary supplement in the US in 1994.
- Doxepin was originally approved in 1969, but Silenor (low-dose doxepin specifically for insomnia) was approved in 2010


Lunesta, Dayvigo, and Quviviq are only available as tablets which seems reasonable considering sleep medications require very precise dosing for safety and efficacy and tablets provide consistent, pre-measured doses compared to other formulations (liquid). This is especially important for these newer drugs which may have narrow therapeutic windows where a higher dose might not have better efficacy but would increase the risk of side effects and a lower dose might not be sufficiently effective.
