This one is working with the insomnia subreddit posts and comments section. 

I am curious about the following: 

- Sample size, how many unique posters and commenters are there
- Identifying the most mentioned insomnia drugs in the subreddit
- How awareness of different drugs/brands changed through time
- What time are people up and posting

Eventually, do a sentiment analysis or emotion detection link to each drug?

Many thanks to Arthur Heitmann for his work with the Artict Shift project, which I used to extract the data from the subreddit.
Check it out here:

Steps so far:
1. Get the jsonl into a DataFrame
2. Clean it; take out "deleted" authors from posts and comments, and work with only the columns I find useful
3. Put together texts columns ("post", "selftext", or "body" columns), export it, and run it through a GPT to get drugs mentioned
4. Get all drugs mentioned to a list, do the sentiment analysis on those drugs
