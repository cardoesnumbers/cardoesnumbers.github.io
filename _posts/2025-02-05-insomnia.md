title: 'What are the most common insomnia treatments (most likely in the US)?'

This one is working with the insomnia subreddit posts and comments section. 

I am curious about the following: 

- Sample size, how many unique posters and commenters are there
- Identifying the most mentioned insomnia drugs in the subreddit
- How awareness of different drugs/brands changed through time
- What time are people up and posting

Eventually, do a sentiment analysis or emotion detection link to each drug?


Many thanks to Arthur Heitmann for his work with the Artict Shift project, which I used to extract the data from the subreddit.
Check it out here:


**https://github.com/ArthurHeitmann/arctic_shift**


Steps so far:
1. Get the jsonl into a DataFrame
2. Clean it; take out "deleted" authors from posts and comments, and work with only the columns I find useful
3. Put together texts columns ("post", "selftext", or "body" columns), export it, and run it through a GPT to get drugs mentioned
4. Get all drugs mentioned to a list, do the sentiment analysis on those drugs

Here is the **comments** notebook

I used Claude 3.5 Sonnet on the resulting csv files to identify the most mentioned drug therapies for the treatment of insomnia:

Out of a total of 58,195 drug mentions analyzed:

- Zolpidem (including mentions as Ambien) is the most frequently mentioned drug, accounting for nearly one-third of all mentions
- Melatonin is the second most common, representing about a quarter of all mentions
- The top three drugs (Zolpidem, Melatonin, and Trazodone) together account for approximately 73% of all insomnia drug mentions in the dataset
- There's a significant presence of both dedicated sleep medications and medications that are sometimes prescribed off-label for sleep (such as quetiapine, antidepressants, and benzodiazepines)

Adding CBT and the different formulations for each drug and the time they were introduced in the US

| Rank | Drug/Molecule | Count | Percentage | Available Formulations | US Market Introduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Zolpidem (Ambien) | 18,517 | 19.17% | Tablets (IR, CR), Sublingual tablets, Oral spray | 1992 |
| 2 | Melatonin | 15,182 | 15.72% | Tablets, Capsules, Gummies, Sublingual tablets, Liquid, Time-release tablets | 1994* |
| 3 | Quetiapine (Seroquel) | 10,603 | 10.98% | Tablets (IR, XR), Oral suspension | 1997 |
| 4 | Trazodone | 8,792 | 9.11% | Tablets (IR, CR), Oral solution | 1981 |
| 5 | Mirtazapine (Remeron) | 5,777 | 5.99% | Tablets, Orally disintegrating tablets, Oral solution | 1996 |
| 6 | Eszopiclone (Lunesta) | 5,729 | 5.94% | Tablets | 2004 |
| 7 | Alprazolam (Xanax) | 5,008 | 5.19% | Tablets (IR, XR), Oral solution, Orally disintegrating tablets | 1981 |
| 8 | Lemborexant (Dayvigo) | 3,419 | 3.54% | Tablets | 2019 |
| 9 | Clonazepam (Klonopin) | 3,316 | 3.44% | Tablets, Orally disintegrating tablets, Oral solution | 1975 |
| 10 | Hydroxyzine (Vistaril) | 2,713 | 2.81% | Tablets, Capsules, Oral solution, IM injection | 1956 |
| 11 | Gabapentin (Neurontin) | 2,366 | 2.45% | Capsules, Tablets, Oral solution | 1993 |
| 12 | Doxepin (Silenor) | 2,340 | 2.42% | Tablets, Capsules, Oral solution, Topical cream | 1969 (2010**) |
| 13 | Lorazepam (Ativan) | 2,272 | 2.35% | Tablets, Oral solution, IV/IM injection, Sublingual tablets | 1977 |
| 14 | Daridorexant (Quviviq) | 1,689 | 1.75% | Tablets | 2022 |
| 15 | Diazepam (Valium) | 1,680 | 1.74% | Tablets, Oral solution, IV/IM injection, Rectal gel | 1963 |
| 16 | CBT-I/CBT Terms | 6,447 | 6.68% | Non-pharmaceutical intervention | N/A |


What stands out is that newer therapies like Lunesta, Dayvigo, and Quviviq are only available as tablets which seems reasonable considering sleep medications require very precise dosing for safety and efficacy and tablets provide consistent, pre-measured doses compared to other formulations (liquid). This is especially important for these newer drugs which may have narrow therapeutic windows where a higher dose might not have better efficacy but would increase the risk of side effects and a lower dose might not be sufficiently effective.
