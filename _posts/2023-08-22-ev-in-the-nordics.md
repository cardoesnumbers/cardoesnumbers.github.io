Last November the Swedish government decided to [stop the klimatbonus](https://www.svt.se/nyheter/regeringen-slopar-klimatbonus-for-elbilar) that owners received with the purchase of their EVs. I had no clue (our car uses bensin) so I wanted to learn about EV sales/infrastructure in the Nordics.

In short, Norway has been leading the way when it comes to EV sales and prioritizing infrastructure (including fast charging stations). Sweden follows but from a distance. Denmark and Finland are still not there yet (at least not until the last time this set was refreshed -2021-.

Here a quick exercise on understanding the development of the EV infrastructure in the Nordics.
