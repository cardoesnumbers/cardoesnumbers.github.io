I also found this set on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rodolfofigueroa/spotify-12m-songs). I thought it could be fun to see how songs have changed (or not) throughout the years, mainly when it comes to length, and also why most songs remain between 3 and 5 minutes long.

There is an explanation for this that brings us back to the early 20th century, you can read it [here](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/655929/why-are-pop-songs-roughly-three-minutes-long).

Here is a brief exploration on song's duration through time / [nbviewer backup here](https://nbviewer.org/github/cardoesnumbers/cardoesnumbers.github.io/blob/main/assets/notebooks/song_length.ipynb)
